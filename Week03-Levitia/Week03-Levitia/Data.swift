    story: "David Hockney, one of the most influential and British artists of the 21 century and a key figure of the pop art movement, who was one of the first to openly speak in the language of painting and photography, turned 82 this year.\n\nHockney has always returned to painting portraits throughout his career. He painted life-size portraits and double portraits of friends, lovers and relatives in a realistic style that artfully conveyed the similarity of his objects.\n\nOne important theme in the artist's work were portraits made in the technique of naturalism. Preparation for such works took a lot of time and effort: Hockney drew numerous sketches, sketches and used photographs for greater accuracy, he could redraw faces and details of paintings ten times. \n\nBy depicting almost life-size figures, David wanted to achieve the effect of an almost real presence of the characters next to the audience. Perhaps more, Hockney's portraits turned to his own figure year after year, creating more than 300 self-portraits.",
